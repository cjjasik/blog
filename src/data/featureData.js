It’s a concept that works, and the bar remain the most awarded pub in the world. In the Taproom, craic reigns supreme. In the Parlor, cocktails are king, and in The Occasional Room, tavern traditions take center stage. The Dead Rabbit isn’t just the best of both worlds, it’s the best of all worlds."
